                                    of this payment solution.</p>
                                <p>It has since developed over the years into something that super exceeds my

                                <p>The Tangi team and administrators have worked tirelessly and have kept the early
                                    investors in the loop through the whole process.</p>
                                <p>What this has transformed into is just genius and it's only going to catapult in
                                    round 2.</p>
                                <p>I have staked my full investment for 18 months as I believe so much in what this team
                                    is going to achieve.</p>
                                <p>The community is fully behind this project and this team. I want to wish team Tangi
                                    well as we approach round 2. You are working so hard and I for one appreciate it. We

                                <p>I am beyond impressed with Tangi's payment solution for the cannabis industry and
                                    beyond. As an early investor, the wait has been worth it. The project has evolved
                                    into much more than I originally invested in.</p>
                                <p>Developments such as, a "Amazon of cannabis" online superstore called The Pickup
                                    Joint, and most importantly, now being bank backed and fully compliant. I trust the
                                    solid and credible team behind Tangi, which includes a ex assistant Chief of Staff
                                    to the President of the USA and a former Prime Minister of Ireland to name a few.
                                    The ROI is looking better and everyday. I encourage my friends, family, and everyone
                                    else to invest in Tangi.</p>

                                    help with seamless transactions. Tangi is going to make things easier and faster.

                                <p>I chose to invest in the Tangi payment and reward solution at its inception nearly 4
                                    years ago. Tired of being scammed in the crypto world, I now only invest in projects
                                    which have a definitive end use and uptake potential. I felt that Tangi offered that
                                    and still do.</p>
                                <p>The project has taken many twists and turns to get to the legal compliance stage it
                                    has reached. It is now poised to roll out into stores providing a long needed
                                    solution to the cash burdened US cannabis industry, providing banking solutions, an
                                    online retailer platform and payment methods for consumers, more akin to the real
                                    world, with opportunities for buyer rewards and incentives.</p>
                                <p>I continue to invest and support this project and would encourage anyone considering
                                    such an investment to take advantage of round 2. This is such an important
                                    investment for me I have staked the majority of the tokens I hold for 18 months,
                                    earning exceptional bonuses in the process.</p>

                                <p>My name is Stephen, and I'm an early investor in the Gettangi project. After
                                    carefully reviewing the team, their whitepaper, and their roadmap, I made the
                                    decision to get involved, not just because of the opportunity, but because of the
                                    integrity and professionalism behind the project.</p>
                                <p>What stood out to me was the unique approach Gettangi is taking to bring compliance,
                                    efficiency, and innovation to the cannabis industry using blockchain technology.
                                    This isn't just a concept, it's a well executed plan backed by a team that clearly
                                    knows what they're doing and has the capability to deliver.</p>
                                <p>As we move into Round 2 of the presale, I believe the fundamentals speak for
                                    themselves. From my experience so far, communication has been transparent, the
                                    community is growing steadily, and the project's vision is gaining real traction.
                                </p>
                                <p>For anyone considering whether to invest, I encourage you to do your own research,
                                    speak to the team, and ask questions in the community.</p>
                                <p>This is one of those rare opportunities and I'm glad I got in early.</p>

                                <p>I bought my first Tangi tokens back in November 2021, and I've been following the
                                    project closely ever since. What stood out to me then (and still does now) is that
                                    Tangi isn't just another crypto trying to follow hype. It's a real solution to a
                                    real problem: fixing the broken payment system in the cannabis industry.</p>
                                <p>What gave me confidence to invest was the team's long-term vision and the way they've
                                    done things right from the start. Tangi is fully compliant, backed by a bank, and
                                    built to grow, something you rarely find in this space. It's refreshing to see a
                                    project that's not only innovative, but also solid and responsible.</p>
                                <p>For anyone looking into Tangi, I'd say this: take the time to understand what they're
                                    building. It's not about hype, it's about solving real-world problems with a
                                    practical, future-ready solution. I'm proud to be an early supporter and truly
                                    believe in what this project stands for.</p>

                                <p>As someone who's been in the crypto space for over five years, I've seen countless
                                    projects come and go. What caught my attention with Tangi Token was its real-world
                                    utility in an industry that's desperately needed innovation — cannabis payments.
                                    After following their progress for the past year, I'm genuinely impressed by the
                                    team's commitment and the technology you've built over four years.</p>
                                <p>The cannabis market is massive, but payment solutions have always been a bottleneck.
                                    Many projects have started and failed in doing so. Tangi Token is solving that
                                    problem with a fast, secure, and borderless system designed specifically for this
                                    space. I got in during Round 1 and have already seen growing interest from both
                                    investors and dispensary owners.</p>
                                <p>With Round 2 priced at $0.80 before a $1.50 public listing, I believe this is one of
                                    those rare opportunities you don't see often in crypto. Tangi isn't just another
                                    token — it's a financial bridge for a $45 billion industry. I'm proud to be part of
                                    this project and can't wait to see where it goes next.</p>

                                <p>As an early investor with Tangi since its inception, I've witnessed firsthand how
                                    this project stands head and shoulders above other crypto ventures. What initially
                                    caught my eye wasn't just the enormous market potential in cannabis payments—it was
                                    the extraordinary caliber of leadership behind it. With advisors including a former
                                    Irish Prime Minister, BitShares founders, and a White House deputy chief of staff,
                                    Tangi assembled a team that commands respect across politics, technology, and
                                    business.</p>
                                <p>The CEO's 20+ years leading high-tech startups, coupled with board members from
                                    prestigious institutions like Canadore College, convinced me this wasn't just
                                    another token project. This diverse, world class team understands blockchain
                                    innovation and the cannabis industry's unique challenges from the inside.</p>
                                <p>While other projects promised quick returns, Tangi built something with genuine
                                    utility and compliance. Watching their methodical approach over the years has only
                                    reinforced my conviction in their vision for revolutionizing cannabis payments.</p>

                                <p>Tangi Token isn't just another crypto project it's a complete ecosystem with
                                    real-world utility that solves one of the most frustrating problems in the cannabis
                                    industry: payments. As a consumer, the experience is seamless. I can pay with my
                                    card or use Tangi tokens, and I actually earn rewards just for shopping. It's
                                    refreshing to see a platform that gives something back to customers and feels simple
                                    enough for anyone to use.</p>
                                <p>From the perspective of retailers I've spoken with, the benefits are massive. Lower
                                    transaction fees, compliant banking services, and an easy path to accepting digital
                                    payments have been game changers. Tangi not only helps dispensaries operate more
                                    efficiently, but it also gives them a presence on 'The Pick Up Joint' marketplace,
                                    expanding their customer base and improving visibility. It's a full service solution
                                    not just a wallet and a coin.</p>
                                <p>As an investor, what stands out most is the clarity of the business model. Tangi
                                    generates real revenue through transaction fees in a $45B+ industry that's only
                                    going to grow. The fact that it's already tested in dispensaries, backed by banking
                                    partnerships, and on track for public listing with a clear roadmap shows serious
                                    long term potential.</p>
                                <p>Tangi isn't a meme or a pump and dump it's a carefully built payment solution with a
                                    seasoned team behind it. With utility, compliance, and scalability baked in, I
                                    believe Tangi is poised to become the standard for cannabis payments and I'm proud
                                    to be a part of the movement from the start.</p>

                                <p>One of the hard truths I've learned in the crypto space is that real utility projects
                                    with strong teams are tough to find. That's exactly what Tangi Token is. Let's be
                                    real, I didn't jump in right away. I took my time to dug deep and did my research
                                    before getting involved. Their decision to fix the payment issues in the cannabis
                                    industry, a multibillion-dollar market still relying on outdated cash systems,
                                    caught my attention. Big problems mean big opportunities especially for us
                                    investors.</p>
                                <p>It was clear Tangi Token weren't just building hype, they're building real solution
                                    to a serious issue with a secure payment system. What convinced me this isn't just
                                    another quick pump and dump was the caliber of the team that includes people with
                                    extensive knowledge and experience in blockchain, finance, regulatory system and the
                                    cannabis industry, and the advisors involved bring even more credibility to the
                                    project.</p>
                                <p>As an early investor of Tangi Token, I'm impressed with the transparency and
                                    communication from the team. The roadmap and goals are realistic and the team always
                                    make sure that they back it up with consistent progress and results.</p>
                                <p>It's still early and I'm excited for the future of Tangi Token. Again this isn't
                                    financial advice, I'm just sharing my two cents. If you're considering Round 2 of
                                    presale, look into it for yourself and do your research and I'm confident you'll see
                                    the potential of this project. For any questions feel free to leave a message on

                                <p>I got into Tangi after a family member gifted me a few hundred tokens. I was told it
                                    was a great investment and that I should read up more on it. Since then, I've seen
                                    the amazing potential in the project and it made me want to be more involved in the

                                <p>I am learning a lot in the web3 world, and crypto space. I would definitely recommend
                                    someone investing into Round 2. Investing in the Tangi team from what I've seen is a
                                    team that really cares for the community.</p>

                                    innovative journey has been nothing short of remarkable. Their dedication to
                                    delivering cutting-edge payment solutions tailored for the cannabis industry is a
                                    game changer. The Tangi Token isn't just a digital currency; it's a revolutionary
                                    leap in how transactions are processed, making them seamless and efficient for both
                                    retailers and consumers.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, their focus on rewards and functionality illustrates a deep
                                    understanding of the market's needs, setting a new benchmark in the legal cannabis
                                    sector. I'm eager to witness the evolution of Tangi as they continue to innovate and
                                    improve their offerings. If you're involved in the cannabis industry, I highly
                                    recommend getting on board with Tangi.</p>

                                <p>I invested in Tangi back in December 2021. The main reason why I invested back then
                                    was because I thought the project was cool. As years went on, and I learned more
                                    about the project, it was a blessing that my brain got me in something that I truly
                                    believe in for the long-term. And as the years past, I got to be a part of this
                                    great community, and I get to help market something that I truly believe can be part
                                    of the future with their digital payment solution.</p>
                                <p>The Tangi team has made me feel a part of the project. I have gotten a few friends to
                                    invest in Tangi. They firmly believed in what I have told them about the project,
                                    and I would do the same again for any person that was to invest in Round 2
                                    pre-sales.</p>
                                <p>I'm very excited for the road that lies ahead for Tangi. This team always seems to
                                    deliver, and I am truly glad I am part of this journey.</p>

                                <p>Hello! I'm Prince and I've been an early supporter of Tangi since the first token
                                    round. I wanted to share why this project captured my attention, why I'm so
                                    impressed with the team, and why I believe others should seriously consider jumping
                                    on board.</p>
                                <p>First and foremost, the Tangi team seems to be the real deal. They're not just
                                    throwing around buzzwords; they've been building this crypto payment solution for
                                    more than four years with a team that includes a CEO who's a blockchain veteran and
                                    advisors like a former Prime Minister and ex-White House Chief of Staff. That's the
                                    kind of muscle that gives me a sense of confidence.</p>
                                <p>Why did I invest? Simple, Tangi's tackling a broken market with massive potential,
                                    and their token is built for real value growth. The cannabis industry is a $45
                                    billion juggernaut in the U.S. alone, but it's crippled by cash-only transactions
                                    because banks steer clear. Tangi's bank-backed, fully legal payment system fixes
                                    that, and their token is the backbone of it.</p>
                                <p>Why should you invest? Tangi isn't selling a dream, it's selling a working solution
                                    in a multi-billion-dollar market. Those 60 million unbanked consumers and thousands
                                    of dispensaries are not just numbers; they're actual people and businesses ready to
                                    use Tangi's system right now.</p>
                                <p>Man, I've been burned by too many crypto projects that talk big and then flop. Tangi
                                    stands out. Tangi's taking on a legit challenge in the cannabis industry, and Ronald
                                    Strauss's team has the expertise to pull it off with flair. I'm excited to see where
                                    this goes, and I think you'd be smart to take a look too.</p>

                                <p>Tangi Token isn't just another crypto currency to me - it's a movement. I'm deeply
                                    passionate about the potential it holds to revolutionize the legal Cannabis
                                    industry. The team's dedication to solving the cash only problem that dispensaries
                                    have resonates with me, and I believe their innovative approach can create lasting
                                    change.</p>
                                <p>What truly touched my heart is the team's commitment to bringing the project to life,
                                    from an idea to a fully functional payment solution that solves a big problem!</p>
                                <p>Yes, the project has been a slow burner but I didn't understand the hurdles that had
                                    to be overcome to get the project ready, the regulation, the banking partnership,
                                    market research, speaking to dispensaries, laying the foundations! It's clear that
                                    the team genuinely cares about making a positive impact.</p>
                                <p>I'm excited to be part of this journey and contribute to the growth of the Tangi
                                    Token community. I've learnt so much since i joined the telegram all those years
                                    ago. I truly believe in the team's vision, and I'm confident that together, we can
                                    achieve great things.</p>
                                <p>Tangi token isn't "just" another crypto project, it's a game changer.</p>
